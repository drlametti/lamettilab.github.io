## Research Areas

### Sensorimotor Control and Learning in Language

The lab investigates how the brain controls speech and hand movements by manipulating feedback across multiple sensory channels. Our work examines sensorimotor control, predictive processing, bilingual language production, and how forward models develop through experience.

Key findings indicate that "memories of hand movements are tied to speech through learning" and that language facilitates "the acquisition of distinct sensorimotor memories for speech."

### Brain Basis of Speech and Language Processing

Beyond behavioral studies, the team explores neural mechanisms underlying speech—particularly cerebellar involvement. We employ neuroimaging meta-analyses, functional MRI, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.

Research shows "reorganization of the neurobiology of speech perception after sentence overlearning" and supports a "domain-general predictive role for the cerebellum" in speech perception.

## Research Areas

### Sensorimotor Control and Learning in Language

The lab manipulates auditory, somatosensory, and visual feedback during movement to examine sensorimotor control, predictive processing, bilingual language production, and forward model acquisition in speech and co-speech hand movements.

### Brain Basis of Speech and Language Processing

In addition to the behavioural work above, we are also interested in the brain basis of speech—in particular, the role of the cerebellum in speech processing. We tackle this problem using large-scale neuroimaging meta-analyses or by combining behavioural manipulations with neural measures like fMRI and noninvasive brain stimulation.

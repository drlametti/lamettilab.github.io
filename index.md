# Speech, Language, and Communication Lab

The Speech, Language, and Communication Lab at Acadia University studies how humans learn to produce, maintain, and remember speech and language. We also examine the social cognition of human-AI interactions. We tackle these problems using behavioural manipulations, brain imaging, and noninvasive brain stimulation.

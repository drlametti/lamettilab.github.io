# Speech, Language, and Communication Lab

The Speech, Language, and Communication Lab at Acadia University studies how humans learn to produce, maintain, and remember speech and language. More recently, we've started to examine the social psychology and neuroscience of human-AI interactions. We tackle these problems using behavioural manipulations, brain imaging, and noninvasive brain stimulation.

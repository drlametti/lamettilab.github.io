# Speech, Language, and Communication Lab

The Speech, Language, and Communication Lab at Acadia University investigates how humans acquire, retain, and execute intricate movements, particularly those involved in speech production. The group has expanded to explore social psychology and AI interaction through behavioral studies, transcranial magnetic stimulation, brain imaging, and computational approaches.
